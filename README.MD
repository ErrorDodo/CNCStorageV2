# CNC Storage Website

## What is this?
This is a website and api for hosting images and videos on the cloud, put it simply it's an image hosting website

## The plan going forward
I don't see myself finishing this in the near future. This project was just for me to mess around with Rust and get a general idea on how it works.

## Issues

- Sometimes the api will fail to connect to the database [README.md](./cnc_api/libs/README.md)
